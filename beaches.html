        <p>Myanmar beaches aren’t exactly the first places you think of going to when visiting the country. But these little known gems are incredibly picturesque and have all the hallmarks of great beaches. Palm trees, blue seas and pale sands offer the perfect place to spend lazy days soaking in the sun. Ngwe Saug or Silver Beach is one of the most popular. There are scuba diving and snorkeling facilities too if you want to explore the water. Cafes and restaurants nearby serve up dish after dish of lip-smacking seafood and snacks.
            Beaches in Myanmar are best visited during December-April when spring lends itself to deliciously warm weather. You can also catch the Water Festival (Thingyan) in April where everyone comes out to celebrate.

        <p>It is located around the Bay of Bengal, the vibrant hues of the blue of the waves adding to the beauty of the place even further. The salt washed boats often come ashore, in and out of the bay, making it one of the most amazing spots to enjoy the freshly caught seafood in. Apart from the relaxing experience, you can also sign up with a tour organizer around the place and get into some of the most popular water sports like scuba diving, jet skiing, sea kayaking and the whole lot.

        <p>Chaungtha is a village and beach resort located in Ayeyarwady Region, Myanmar. Chaungtha Beach, as it is more commonly known, is about 5 hours' drive away from Yangon, and is a popular resort with Yangonites from October to April.Chaungtha received its name from the small stream (chaung) which flowed at the western part ... Wikivoyage has a travel guide for Chaung Tha.As it is relatively more affordable than the nearby Ngwesaung and Ngapali beaches, Chaungtha is also more crowded and less cleanly than the two more expensive and better maintained beaches.Chaungtha is renowned for its fresh and reasonably priced seafood. A major attraction is a small pagoda built on a limestone boulder at the southern end of the beach. Nearby fishing villages and tidal mangrove forests are also popular among the tourists.</p>
